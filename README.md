TechnicolorDreamsArcade
=======================

Technicolor is a 2D Platformer still in prototype and conceptualization phase. The game is color based where the main objective is to color a black and white world by solving different puzzles and completing different obstacles. One of puzzles being an easy to complex circuit puzzle in which you connect different colored wires in order to change the color of a light, which in turn makes different tools or pieces required to fix a pipe visible. Once the pipe is fixed you can flood color into the world and save everyone from darkness.

Technicolor Dreams Arcade is written in Java using the Slick2D library.
